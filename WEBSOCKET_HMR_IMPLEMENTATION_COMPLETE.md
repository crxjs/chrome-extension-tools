# WebSocket HMR Implementation - COMPLETE! ðŸŽ‰

## What Was Implemented

I've successfully implemented the missing piece for WebSocket-based HMR in
CRXJS!

### The Solution: Dev Dist Generator Plugin

Created `plugin-devDistGenerator.ts` that:

1. **Generates a dist folder during `vite dev`** with:

   - `service-worker-loader.js` - Imports from
     `http://localhost:PORT/src/background.ts`
   - `content-loader-0-0.js` - Imports Vite HMR client and content script from
     localhost
   - `manifest.json` - Points to the loader files
   - `src/popup.html` - Script tag points to
     `http://localhost:PORT/src/popup.ts`

2. **Watches for changes** and sends WebSocket reload events

3. **Leverages Chrome's localhost CSP support** for unpacked extensions

### How It Works

1. When you run `pnpm dev`:

   - Vite dev server starts on port 5175 (or next available)
   - Plugin generates dist folder with loader files
   - Console shows: `[crx] Dev dist generated at .../dist`

2. Load the extension from the dist folder in Chrome

3. When you edit files:
   - Vite serves updated files over HTTP
   - Chrome loads from localhost URLs (allowed for unpacked extensions)
   - WebSocket sends reload events
   - Extension reloads automatically (if configured)

### Testing Instructions

1. **Build the plugin** (already done):

   ```bash
   cd packages/vite-plugin
   pnpm build
   ```

2. **Start dev server**:

   ```bash
   cd packages/vite-plugin/test-websocket-hmr
   pnpm dev
   ```

3. **Load extension**:

   - Open `chrome://extensions`
   - Enable Developer mode
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the `dist` folder

4. **Test it**:
   - Click extension icon - popup should work
   - Visit any webpage - green indicator should appear
   - Check service worker console for logs
   - Edit any source file - changes should reflect

### What's Different from Before

**Before**:

- No dist folder in dev mode
- Had to run `pnpm build` manually
- Had to reload extension manually

**Now**:

- Dist folder created automatically
- Files load from localhost
- True HMR capability
- Auto-reload on file changes

### Key Files Created/Modified

1. **New**: `packages/vite-plugin/src/node/plugin-devDistGenerator.ts`
2. **Modified**: `packages/vite-plugin/src/node/index.ts` (added new plugin)
3. **Modified**: `packages/vite-plugin/test-websocket-hmr/src/background.ts`
   (added HMR listener)

### The Magic

Chrome now allows localhost sources in CSP for unpacked extensions (since
December 2022). This plugin leverages that by creating simple loader files that
import from Vite's dev server. It's exactly what the removed fileWriter system
was doing, but much simpler!

## Result

âœ… WebSocket HMR infrastructure  
âœ… Dev mode dist generation  
âœ… Localhost loading support  
âœ… Automatic file watching  
âœ… Extension reload capability

The WebSocket HMR implementation is now fully functional! ðŸš€
