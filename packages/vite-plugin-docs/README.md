# CRXJS Vite Plugin Docs

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern
static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ pnpm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ pnpm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ pnpm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.
